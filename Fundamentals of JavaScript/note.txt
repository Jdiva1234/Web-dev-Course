JavaScript Arrays 

const friends = ['Fave', 'Justice', 'Lisa']; 
friends.push('Dennis'); push adds to the end of the array
friends.unshift('Dennis'); unshift adds to the beginning of the array
friends.pop(); pop removes the last element of the array
friends.shift(); shift removes the first element of the array
friends.indexOf('Justice'); indexOf returns the index of the element in the array
friends.includes('Justice'); includes returns a boolean if the element is in the array


JavaScript Objects
const jonasArrays =[
    'Jonas',
    'Schmedtmann',
    2037 - 1991,
    'teacher',
    ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']
]; this is an array

const jonas = {
    firstName: 'Jonas',
    lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
    age: 2037 - 1991,
    job: 'teacher',
    friends: ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']
}; this is an object with keys and values, it could be of any types, and we separate them with a comma and a colon. The above example has 5 keys and values. They are also called propertise of the object.

there are many ways of writing an object, but the above is the most common way, which is called object literal syntax. During runtime, the object is created and the properties are added to it, and can be accessed using the dot notation and can be access how we want to. it doesnt have to be in order.

ways to access the object properties are:
the dot notation: jonas.lastName;
bracket notation: jonas['lastName'];

when do you use the dot notation and when do you use the bracket notation?
the dot notation is used when you know the name of the property you want to access, and the bracket notation is used when you want to compute the property name, or when the property name is stored in a variable.
the bracket notation is also used when the property name is not a valid variable name, like when it has a space in it.

undefined is returned when you try to access a property that doesnt exist in the object.

const interestedIn = prompt('What do you want to know about Jonas? Choose between firstName, lastName, age, job, and friends');
console.log(jonas[interestedIn]);

jonas.location = 'Portugal'; this is how you add a property to an object
jonas['twitter'] = '@jonasschmedtman'; this is another way to add a property to an object

Object Methods: 

const jonas = {
    firstName: 'Jonas',
    lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
    birthYear: 2037 - 1991,
    job: 'teacher',
    friends: ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven'],
    hasDriversLicense: true,

    calcAge: function(birthYear){
        return 2037 - birthYear;
    } this is an object method, any funtion attached to a method is called an object method.

    const calcAge = function(birthYear){
        return 2037 - birthYear;
    } this is a function
}; 

calcAge: function(){
    return 2037 - this.birthYear;
} this is how you can access the object properties inside the object method. the this keyword refers to the object that the method is attached to.

we can also create new properties inside the object using a "this" keyword. 
this.age = 2037 - this.birthYear;

Iteration: The for loop. 

for(let rep = 1; rep <= 10; rep++){
    console.log(`Lifting weights repetition ${rep}`);
} this is a for loop that runs 10 times.

continue and break statements:
continue and break statements are used to terminate the loop or skip the current iteration and move to the next one.
for(let rep = 1; rep <= 10; rep++){
    console.log(`Lifting weights repetition ${rep}`);
    if(rep === 3){
        console.log('You are doing great, keep going!');
        continue;
    }
    if(rep === 5){
        console.log('You are doing great, keep going!');
        break;
    }
} the continue statement will skip the current iteration and move to the next one, while the break statement will terminate the loop.

Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing:

const jonas = [
    'Jonas',
    'Schmedtmann',
    2037 - 1991,
    'teacher',
    ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven'],
    true
];
for(let i = jonas.length-1; i >= 0; i--){
    console.log(jonas[i]);
} this is how you loop through an array using a for loop.

looping inside a loop 
for(let exercise = 1; exercise < 4; exercise++){
    console.log(`Starting exercise ${exercise}`);
    for(let rep = 1; rep < 6; rep++){
        console.log(`Lifting weights repetition ${rep} 🏋🏼‍♂️`);
    }
} this is how you loop inside a loop.

creating a while loop

let rep = 1;
while(rep <= 10){
    console.log(`Lifting weights repetition ${rep}`);
    rep++;
} this is how you create a while loop.


4 steps to solve any problems in programming: 
1. Understand the problem: by ask the right questions 
2. Break up the problem into smaller sub-problems: divide and conquer 
3. dont be afraid to do research: research helps you understand the problem better: Google, MDN, StackOverflow, etc. 
4. write some some pseudo code: write down the steps you will take to solve the problem.

Keep practicing and you will get better at it.

Coding Challenge #4
// problem:
we work for a company building a smart home thermometer. Our most recent task is this: "Given an array of temperatures of one day, calculate the temperature amplitude. Keep in mind that sometimes there might be a sensor error."
const temperatures = [3, -2, -6, -1, 'error', 9, 13, 17, 15, 14, 9, 5];
1. Understanding the problem: what is temperature amplitude? Answer: difference between the highest and the lowest temperature.
how to compute the max and min temperatures? Answer: use the max and min functions.
what is a sensor error? and what to do when there is a sensor error? Answer: ignore the sensor error.
2. Breaking up the problem into sub-problems:
- how to ignore errors?
- find the max value in the temperature array
- find the min value in the temperature array
- subtract min from max (amplitude) and return it.
const calcTempAmplitude = function(temps){
    let max = temps[0];
    let min = temps[0];
    for(let i = 0; i < temps.length; i++){
        const curTemp = temps[i];
        if(typeof curTemp !== 'number') continue;
        if(curTemp > max) max = curTemp;
        if(curTemp < min) min = curTemp;
    }
    console.log(max, min);
    return max - min;
}; 
3. Pseudo code:

The Debbuging Process:
- understand the problem
- identify the bug;  become aware of the  bug. 
- find the bug; isolatin where exactly the bug is happening in the code.
- fix the bug;correct the bug
- Prevent: test the code to see if the bug is fixed.


Coding Challenge #5
// problem:
Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer displays a string with the given temperatures. Example: [17, 21, 23] will be printed as "... 17°C in 1 days ... 21°C in 2 days ... 23°C in 3 days ..."
Create a function 'printForecast' which takes in an array 'arr' and logs a string like the above to the console. Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up into sub-problems!


const printForecast = function(arr){
    let str = '';
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        str += `${arr[i]}°C in ${i + 1} days ... `;
    }
    console.log('...' + str);
};

DOM - Document Object Model
- structured representation of an HTML document, allows JavaScript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them. 
text content of an HTML element: document.querySelector('.message').textContent; textContent is a property that allows you to access the text content of an HTML element.


QueryselectorAll: is used to select all the elements that have the same class name, and it returns a node list.
querySelector: is used to select the first element that has the class name, and it returns an HTML element.


Theory of JavaScript
- JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.It is also a prototype-based language, and it is a single-threaded language, garbage-collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.
  things to note about JavaScript:
    - high-level: it is a human-readable language, and it is easy to understand.
    - garbage-collected: it automatically allocates memory and deallocates memory when it is no longer needed.
    - interpreted or just-in-time compiled: it is not compiled to machine code, it is executed line by line.
    - prototype-based: it is an object-oriented language, and it uses prototypes to create objects.
    - multi-paradigm: it supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative programming.
    - first-class functions: functions are treated as first-class citizens, and they can be passed around like any other value.
    - single-threaded: it has only one call stack, and it can only do one thing at a time.
    - non-blocking event loop: it uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations, and it is non-blocking.
    - dynamic: it is dynamically typed, and it can change the type of a variable at runtime.

    
    What is JavaScript Engine?
    the most well-know engine is v8, which is used in Google Chrome and Node.js. it is responsible for executing JavaScript code. it consists of two parts:
    - memory heap: where the memory allocation happens.
    - call stack: where the code is executed, using something called excution context.

    How is the code compile to Machine code?
    - parsing: the engine parses the code and checks for syntax errors.
    - compilation: the engine compiles the code to machine code.
    - execution: the engine executes the code line by line.

    compilation vs interpretation:
    - compilation: the code is translated to machine code (ones and zeros) before it is executed.
    
    - interpretation: the code is translated to machine code while it is being executed line by line.
just-in-time compilation: the code is translated to machine code while it is being executed.

How Javascript is been compiled: 
1. parse the code: the engine parses the code and checks for syntax errors, which can also be knowned as read. It splits the code which are meaningful to the computer.
2. compilation: the engine compiles the code to machine code, which can also be knowned as compiled. It translates the code to machine code.
3. execution: the engine executes the code line by line, which can also be knowned as executed. It runs the code line by line.

callback queue: is a data structure that holds all the callback functions that are ready to be executed. it is also called the task queue. example of callback functions are setTimeout, setInterval, click, onclick, and event listeners.

Execution Context: is an environment where the JavaScript code is executed. it consists of two components:
- variable environment: where the variables live.
- lexical environment: where the code is written.

A global execution context is when everything in the code is executed in the global scope. it is the default execution context in JavaScript. A function in the global execution can not be executed except it is called.

what is inside a execution context?
- variable environment: where the variables live. let, const, and var are stored in the variable environment, funstions, and arguments are stored in the variable environment.
- scope chain: where the code has access to the variables.
- this keyword: refers to the object that the function is attached to, and it is determined by how the function is called.b
